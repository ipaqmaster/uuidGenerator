# uuidGenerator

This is a script for generating UUIDs. It also seems to double double as a single/multi-thread performance benchmark.

# Usage

By default the script generates a single uuid. More can be generated by setting `--count #`


## Arguments

`--count ###` To specify how many UUIDs to generate.

`--flood` to generate indefinitely until interrupted.

`--threaded` Used with `--flood` to spawn additional processes for the purpose of generating more UUIDs per second.

`--threads` Used with `--threaded` to specify how many threads to spawn. By default this uses the full cpu thread count of the machine.
